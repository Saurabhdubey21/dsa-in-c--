#include<bits/stdc++.h>
//we use <bits/stdc++.h> to include all the libraries of c++
//if we use #include<iostream> then we have to include all the libraries separately
//like #include<cmath> for math functions
using namespace std;
//using namespace std is used to avoid writing std:: before every function of c++
int main()
//main function is the starting point of the program
{
    cout<<"Hello World";
    //cout is used to print the output on the screen
    return 0;
    //return 0 is used to end the program and 0 is returned to the operating system
